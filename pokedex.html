                    I wanted to create a personal project using react to practice what I had learned through tutorials. 
                    Growing up with Pokemon I have a nostalgia driven passion about the topic so I decided I would create my own pokedex 
                    I found pokeAPI to fetch my data from initially.
                    Whilst working on this project I learned to fetch data using async/await.
                    I practiced handling server errors, and using conditional rendering to display the pokemon data (sprite, type, id and name).
                    Although the pokedexes functionality was all there, visually the simple search form left much to be desired,
                    so I designed the user interface to reflect an oldschool pokedex. 
                    To aid in the design process I incorporated some material UI to import icons and include a hovering
                    tooltip to help when searching for gender specific pokemon that had different names within the API itself.
